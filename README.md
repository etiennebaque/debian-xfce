Here's some help to troubleshoot a few issues that may occur after a fresh install of Debian Xfce
- [Videos shows horizontal tears, and the quality is not great](#video_tears)
- [Middle tap on touchpad is not working](#middle_tap)
- [How to make Qt apps match dark themes on Xfce?](#qt_dark)
- [Map Caps-lock key to Ctrl](#caps_ctrl)
- [Install DVD plugin for VLC](#plugin_vlc)

### <a name='video_tears'></a>Videos show horizontal tears and their quality is not great

Create `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf` (if your have an Intel graphic card) and add the following content in it:
```
Section "Device"
  Identifier  "Intel Graphics"
  Driver      "Intel"
  Option      "TearFree"    "true"
EndSection
```
You may need to turn off compositing ('Window manager tweaks' > 'Compositor').

### <a name="middle_tap"></a>Middle tap on touchpad is not working

Create `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-libinput.conf` and add the following content in it:
```
Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "libinput touchpad catchall"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"
        MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
        Driver "libinput"
        Option "Tapping" "on"
EndSection
```

### <a name='qt_dark'></a>How to make Qt apps match dark themes on Xfce?

Open `~/.config/Trolltech.conf` and add the following lines
```
[Qt]
style=GTK+
```
Save and exit the file. Then run the following:
```
sudo apt-get install qt5-style-plugins
```
Finally, open `/etc/environment` and add this line:
```
QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=gtk2
```   
Finally, restart the computer.

### <a name='caps_ctrl'></a>Map Caps-lock key to Ctrl
- Open `Session and Startup` (via the Whisker menu, for example), click on the `Application Autostart` tab.

- In the small window, enter a name and add this command: `/usr/bin/setxkbmap -option 'ctrl:nocaps'`. OK and leave.
- Restart your computer.

### <a name='plugin_vlc'></a>Install DVD plugin for VLC
Add the following lines in `/etc/apt/sources.list`
```
deb https://download.videolan.org/pub/debian/stable/ /
deb-src https://download.videolan.org/pub/debian/stable/ /
```
Save and leave. Then update repositories:
```
sudo apt-get update
```
then run:
```
wget -O - https://download.videolan.org/pub/debian/videolan-apt.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```
Finally, install the `libdvdcss2` library:
